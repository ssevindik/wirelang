# WireLang — Home

This document is the single-entry home page for the WireLang documentation. It provides a concise feature table and links to detailed pages for each area.

| Area | Short Description | Link |
|------|-------------------|------|
| Overview & Quick Start | Project purpose, install & run commands | [Overview](./API.md#quick-start) |
| Components | Passive components, diodes, LEDs, transistors, op-amps, logic gates | [Components](./components.md) |
| Op-Amps | Detailed op-amp models and usage (5-pin / 3-pin) | [Op-Amps](./op-amps.md) |
| Sources | Voltage & current sources (DC/AC), power rails | [Sources](./sources.md) |
| Passives | Resistors, capacitors, inductors and unit helpers | [Passives](./passives.md) |
| Logic Gates | Digital gates, inputs (HIGH/LOW), clock | [Logic Gates](./logic-gates.md) |
| Units | `kOhm`, `uF`, `mH`, `kHz` helpers and examples | [Units](./units.md) |
| API Reference | Circuit creation, Schematic methods, helpers | [API](./api.md) |
| Examples | Ready-to-run examples and how to run them | [Examples](./examples.md) |

If you want one focused page added (for example a full component-by-component reference), request it and I will add it under `docs/` and link it here.
